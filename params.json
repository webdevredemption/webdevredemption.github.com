I've created this name/organization on Github to keep track of my ideas better (and the name does sound pretty cool, was randomly thought up at college).\r\n\r\n## First Idea: project.json\r\n\r\n### What is it?\r\n\r\nA single json file that is used by all front-end development tools to access a project's structure information as well as configuration. [More info](http://github.com/webdevredemption/project.json)\r\n\r\n### Why should it be used?\r\n\r\nCreating a standard method of accessing the properties and configuration of a project now will allow the current tools to be used with existing projects (if a project.json file is created for that project) and ensure that there is a standard for the future development of front-end tools.\r\n\r\n### How will it expand/extend with new tools?\r\n\r\nBeing json the file will be very easy to expand, a [sample file](https://github.com/webdevredemption/project.json/blob/master/project.json) is located in the repository and be used as a proof of concept. simply adding the require file checking to a new tool and creating a new object in an existing project.json is all that is required to expand.\r\n\r\n### Any proof of this in practice?\r\n\r\nDue to the early stages of the idea I am yet to implement this theory in to practice, however I have plans to do so in the near future (see forked repositories).","google":"UA-27807546-3","name":"Web Dev Redemption!"}
